TODO: actual readme.

pixra (or "xra" for short) is an image editor designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi. It is the Lojban word for "picture", and the x is that pholegmy sound that doesn't show up in English, but does show up in German and various Middle-Eastern languages.

It runs in a 16bpp video mode. If you think this will ever run in a higher pixel depth, think again.

It is designed to edit 8bpp colour-indexed images with a 24bpp palette.

TODO: Actually make this an editor.
