pixra (or "xra" for short) is an image editor designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi. It is designed to edit 256-colour (8bpp) images with a 24bpp palette, and dithers it so it looks nice for the Raspi's native depth of 16bpp.

"pixra" is the Lojban word for "picture", and the x is that pholegmy sound that doesn't show up in English, but does show up in German and various Middle-Eastern languages.

Just in case you were wondering.

See USAGE.md for information on how to actually use pixra (namely, the shortcuts).
Or, of course, you can press F1 for in-app quick help.
TIP: Printing it off is a good idea.

=== TODOs ===
* The palette editing stuff is a bit lacking. I'd like to see these things:
  * Palette clipboard
  * Interpolate between colours
* "Tile assist" modes, mostly for making seamless tiles.
* Now that we have a font, I'd like to see it used MORE.
