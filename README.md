pixra (or "xra" for short) is an image editor designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi. It is designed to edit 256-colour (8bpp) images with a 24bpp palette, and dithers it so it looks nice for the Raspi's native depth of 16bpp.

"pixra" is the Lojban word for "picture", and the x is that pholegmy sound that doesn't show up in English, but does show up in German and various Middle-Eastern languages.

Just in case you were wondering.
